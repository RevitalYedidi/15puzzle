# Switch-15-Puzzle

My first Game using React.js


The game is based on 15-puzzle where the goal is to arrange the numbers on the board in ascending order.

The game was built for "The Program for Talented Youth in Mathematics" at Bar Ilan University as a method for understanding the issue of transformations.

### The progress of the game:

Unlike the original game - there is no empty slot and the moves are made by switching between 2 tiles by clicking on the two cells you want to swap.
Any number in its place on the board is painted green.
When all the numbers are arranged in the correct order - a message appears and the level is completed.

At any time you can start the level again, and see the number of moves made so far, and after starting a level again you can see all the numbers of moves made at this point.

There are 4 different arrangements of a board that can be arranged, you can switch between them with the buttons to the right of the game board.
